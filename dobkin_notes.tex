\part{Dobkin's Results}

The Delaunay triangulation of a set of points in the plane is a
spanner with spanning ratio $c \le ((1 + \sqrt{5})/2)\pi \approx
5.08$.  This was proven in the paper ``Delaunay Graphs Are Almost as
Good as Complete Graphs'' by Dobkin, Friedman, and Supowit
\cite{Dobkin:1987} \cite{Dobkin:1990}.

\section{Introduction}

Let $S$ be a set of points in the plane and $DT(S)$ be the edges of
the Delaunay triangulation of $S$.  Let a path along the Delaunay
edges be a \emph{direct DT path}.

\section{One-Sided Path: The Easy Case}

If all edges along the direct DT path between points $a,b \in S$ are
either all above or all below the line connecting $a,b$, we say that
this is a one-sided path.

\begin{Lemma}

  Points along a direct DT path are monotonic in $x$.

\end{Lemma}

\begin{Lemma}

  All points along the direct DT path from $a$ to $b$ are contained
  within or on the boundary of the circle with $a$ and $b$
  diametrically opposed.
  
\end{Lemma}

\begin{Lemma}

  The boundary of a connected union of circles has boundary at most
  $\pi \cdot (x_r - x_l)$ where $x_r$ and $x_l$ are the extreme x
  coordinates of any of the circles.
  
\end{Lemma}

From these lemmas, it follows the direct DT path is at most $\pi/2$
times as long as the euclidean distance between the endpoints.

\part{Dobkin's Results}

The Delaunay triangulation of a set of points in the plane is a
spanner with spanning ratio $c \le ((1 + \sqrt{5})/2)\pi \approx
5.08$.  This was proven in the paper ``Delaunay Graphs Are Almost as
Good as Complete Graphs'' by Dobkin, Friedman, and Supowit
\cite{Dobkin:1987} \cite{Dobkin:1990}.

\section{Introduction}

Let $S$ be a set of points in the plane and $DT(S)$ be the edges of
the Delaunay triangulation of $S$.  Let a path along the Delaunay
edges be a \emph{direct DT path}.

\section{One-Sided Path: The Easy Case}

If all edges along the direct DT path between points $a,b \in S$ are
either all above or all below the line connecting $a,b$, we say that
this is a one-sided path.
